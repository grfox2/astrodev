        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <section class="text-content">
          <p class="text">When choosing a telescope, it is useful to know some quantities such as the power or magnification, the focal ratio, and
           the resolving power or angular resolution. This calculator helps you to calculate these numbers. You just need three
           basic parameters: the telescope's aperture diameter, its focal length, and the eyepiece's focal length. If you wish, you
           can include a Barlow lens or a focal reducer. Introduce the required values below and
           press calculate. The results will appear in the sections just under the input form.

        <h2>What do these results mean?</h2>
        
        <!--Magnification description-->
        <h3 id="magnification-desc">Magnification</h3>
        <section class="text-content">
          <p class="text">This is a measure of the telescope's power and it is calculated by dividing the telescope's focal length over the eyepiece's
           focal length. This means that you can change your telescope's power if you change your eyepiece. The smaller the eyepiece's
           focal length, the larger the magnification. Magnification can also be increased by using a Barlow lens. As you increase the 
           power, the object will become larger, but this will be at the  cost of a dimmer image and a smaller field of view. Higher 
           magnifications are recommended for observing planets, while deep sky objects are better viewed with intermediate or lower values 
           depending on the object. A telescope's power has upper and lower limits that depend on the optics and physical limitations of 
           the instrument. Their explanation can be found in more technical references. For our purpose, it is enough to know there is 
           no real advantage of using very high magnifications.

        <!--Focal Ratio description-->
        <h3 id="focal-ratio-desc">Focal Ratio f/</h3>
        <section class="text-content">
          <p class="text">This parameter, more known to photographers, is obtained from dividing the telescope's focal length by the telescope's objective 
           diameter. A higher f/ number implies that the field of view will be smaller and the magnification higher. For an astrophotographer, 
           a higher f/ ratio means that a given image will require a longer exposure time in comparison to a telescope with a lower f/ number.
           As in photography, telescopes with a low f/ number are known as fast and those with a high value are regarded as slow. If you are
           aiming to use your telescope for astrophotography, then this will be an important parameter to have in mind when choosing the right
           equipment and planning your projects. Also, if your telescope's focal ratio is on the higher end, it is possible to decrease it by
           attaching a focal reducer to it.

        <!--Resolving Power description-->
        <h3 id="resolution-desc">Resolving Power</h3>
        <section class="text-content">
          <p class="text">The telescope's resolving power is a measure of the smallest detail (in terms of angular size) on the sky that you can discern
           with your telescope. For example, if your telescope has a resolving power of 3 arcsec and a binary star has a separation of 1.5 arcsec,
           you will not be able to see the individual stars and the system will appear as a bright point. The resolving power is directly related 
           to the telescope's aperture diameter. A larger diameter will provide a higher resolving power. The resolution is also affected by 
           diffraction (the bending of light waves as they enter the optical aperture), so it is really determined by the optical design of the 
           instrument. For a representative value, we use Dawes' formula to calculate the resolving power. A 60mm telescope has a resolving power of
           1.9 arcsec. As a reference, as given above, the Hercules Globular Cluster (M13) is about 1200 arcsec wide, the Ring Nebula (M57) is 
           about 230 arcsec wide, the binary star system Albireo A and B are separated by about 35 arcsec, and the Cassini Division is less 
           than 1 arcsec wide.
